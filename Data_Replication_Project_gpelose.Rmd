#Introduction

***
Astraniga pocualta is a faculatively symbiotic coral species that is Native to New England. Its capabilities to live with or without zoozanthaellie is that makes this organism faculatively symbiotic and thus a model organism for studying coral bleaching. 
</br>
This study focuses on looking at how microplastics are affecting Astrangia poculata.

##Methodology 

  

##Getting data from excel into R

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
```


#Figure 1

##To start, you need to pull in the data from R, 

```{r}
Figure_1 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.1")
summary(Figure_1)
```

##Creating a plot in ggplot

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
ggplot(data=Figure_1,aes(x=MP_type,y=MP_count))+geom_boxplot()+xlab("Plastic Type")+ylab("no. plastics per polyp")+scale_y_continuous(lim=c(0,100),breaks=c(0,20,40,60,80,100))+theme_classic()+annotate("text", x = "Beads", y = 30, label = "A")+annotate("text", x = "Fibers", y = 92, label = "B")+annotate("text", x = "Misc", y = 22, label = "A")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

##Statistical Analysis



#Figure 2

##Pulling data in from excell 
```{r}
Figure_2 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.2")
summary(Figure_2)
names(Figure_2)
```

##Using ggplot to create Figure 2


```{r, fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
plot_2 <- ggplot(Figure_2, aes(x=colony,y=MP_ingested))
plot_2 + geom_histogram(stat="identity",aes(fill=location))+annotate("text", x = 1, y = 100, label = "57.5%")+annotate("text", x = 2, y = 135, label = "74.7%")+annotate("text", x = 3, y = 19, label = "88.6%")+scale_y_continuous(lim=c(0,250),breaks=c(0,50,100,150,200,250))
```

I was unable to move the legend to the top, I would do this in photo shop if I had access to the application.  

I could change the colors to be black and white like they were in the graph but I actually downloaded the paper and the graphs contain colors and I like the colors as well so I am going to keep them!

Question#
How perfect does this have to be compared to the graph online? I can get rid of the lines in the background and change the color and I did that but I like the color better. 

#Figure 3

```{r, fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
Figure_3 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
     sheet = "GP-Fig.3")
summary(Figure_3)
boxplot(Figure_3, ylab="particles consumed (mm^3)")
```
I wanted to try and create this graph using the graphing system portrayed by R and I was able to. 


#Figure 4 Plot 1!

```{r}
Fig.4_plot.1 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.4-Cope")
summary(Fig.4_plot.1)
```

```{r}
Figure_4_plot_1 <- ggplot(Fig.4_plot.1, aes(x=treatment,y=copepods))
copepods <- Figure_4_plot_1 + geom_violin()+theme_classic()
copepods
```


##Plot 2 from figure 4

```{r}
Fig.4_plot.2 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.4-Brine")
summary(Fig.4_plot.2)
```


```{r}
Figure_4_plot_2 <- ggplot(Fig.4_plot.2, aes(x=treatment,y=brine))
brine <- Figure_4_plot_2 + geom_violin()+theme_classic()
brine
```

##Plot 3 from figure 4

```{r}
Fig.4_plot.3 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.4-Egg")
summary(Fig.4_plot.3)
```


```{r}
Figure_4_plot_3 <- ggplot(Fig.4_plot.3, aes(x=treatment,y=eggs))
eggs <- Figure_4_plot_3 + geom_violin()+theme_classic()
eggs
```

##adding all three of these figures together!
```{r}
grid.arrange(copepods, brine, eggs)
```

#Figure 5

```{r}
Figure_5 <- read_excel("individual_project.xlsx", 
    sheet = "GP-Fig.5")
summary(Figure_5)
plot(Figure_5)
```

##Now I am going to try and create this plot through using ggplot.

```{r}
plot_5 <- ggplot(Figure_5, aes(x="brine shrimp egg ingestion (mm^3)",y="Microplastic Ingestion (mm^3)"))
plot_5 + geom_jitter() + theme_classic()
```
